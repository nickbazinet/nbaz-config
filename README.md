# Config

This repository was created in order to have a centralize place where I could keep all my custom configuration that I would like to keep on multiple setup.
This project was also a good way to really understand what is going-on on my computer and learning the usefullness of some files on it.

#### Why Public ? 

I decided to have this repository public in the case that anyone was looking for a similar setup or that knows way to improve my "quality of life" tools. 

## Directories

### Root

The *root* directory of this project contains either global configuration files  that are generic to any Operation System or related to tools that are used the same way across different OS.

### linux

The *linux* directory contains files related to a Linux box only. Contains configuration files for tools like tmux, ssh, bashrc, etc.

### nvim

Contains the configuration file for my Neovim setup. This is a big *work-in-progress* since I'm new to Neovim and this file is at the point of plain copy/paste. 

# Contribution

Issues or Pull Request are welcome for any changes that I could do in order to improve my configuration. But remember that this is *my* configuration files.
